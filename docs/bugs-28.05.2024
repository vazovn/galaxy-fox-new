1. Needed to replace the file

/cluster/galaxy-test/srv/galaxy/server/lib/galaxy/model/store/discovery.py

/cluster/galaxy-test/srv/galaxy/server/lib/galaxy/model/__init__.py

by a newer version (diff prod) - some methods were not working.

Next time we shall run the playbook again with `force` option to pull the changes.

The old versions are stil in place (*.original) for comparison.
