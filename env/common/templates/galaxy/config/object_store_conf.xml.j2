            <description>All MSI researchers have access to a high-performance, high capacity primary storage platform. This system currently provides 3.5 PB (petabytes) of storage. The integrity of the data is protected by daily snapshots and tape backups. It has sustained read and write speeds of up to 25 GB/sec.

There is default access to this storage by any MSI group with an active account. Very large needs can be also met, but need to be approved by the MSI HPC Allocation Committee. More details are available on the [Storage Allocations](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/storage-allocations) page.

More information about MSI Storage can be found [here](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/data-storage).

            <description>MSI first added a Ceph object storage system in November 2014 as a second tier storage option. The system currently has around 10 PB of usable storage installed.

MSI's second tier storage is designed to address the growing need for resources that support data-intensive research. It is tightly integrated with other MSI storage and computing resources in order to support a wide variety of research data life cycles and data analysis workflows. In addition, this object storage platform offers new access modes, such as Amazon’s S3 (Simple Storage Service) interface, so that researchers can better manage their data and more seamlessly share data with other researchers whether or not the other researcher has an MSI account or is at the University of Minnesota.

            <description>MSI Ceph storage that is purged more aggressively (weekly instead of monthly) and so it only appropriate for short term methods development and such. The rapid deletion of stored data enables us to provide this storage without a quota.

            <description>Much of the data analysis conducted on MSI’s high-performance computing resources uses data gathered from UMN shared research facilities (SRFs). In recognition of the need for short to medium term storage for this data, MSI provides a service, Shared User Research Facilities Storage (SURFS), enabling SRFs to deliver data directly to MSI users. By providing a designated location for this data, MSI can focus data backup and other processes to these key datasets.  As part of this service, MSI will provide the storage of the data for one year from its delivery date.

It's expected that the consumers of these data sets will be responsible for discerning which data they may wish to keep past the 1-year term, and finding an appropriate place to keep it. There are several possible storage options both at MSI and the wider university. You can explore your options using OIT’s digital [storage options chooser tool](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/comparisons/select-digital-storage-options).
