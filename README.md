# Lifeportal on FOX

# Some custom requirements

## Setup of `systemd` as a **galaxy** user

- all changes are in the branch *user-systemd*
- all patches are in the directory `user-systemd-patches`


## log4s issue and socks solution

To run the ansible paybook from your local machine on *galaxy01.educloud.no* :

- Download & compile the polipo package which sets the proxy protocol to http before sending it to sock5 proxy

			wget https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/files/polipo/polipo-1.1.1.tar.gz

	This must be done on a machine which has an outbound connection 

- Copy the compiled binary to galaxy01.educloud.no (`/usr/local/bin/`)

- open a terminal as ( with One-Time Code and your password) and type:

			ssh -D 12354 fox.educloud.no & polipo socksParentProxy=localhost:12354 localDocumentRoot=""  proxyPort=3128 &

- leave the terminal open and use another terminal

- modify the main playbook file *galaxy-educloud.yml* file - add the proxy variable under `-hosts`

	  environment:
			 https_proxy: http://localhost:8123
			 http_proxy: http://localhost:8123
    
 - patch the file 

		/patches/virtenv_pythonpath.patch

    to

		/roles/galaxyproject.galaxy/tasks/virtualenv.yml

    The goal of this patch is to use system-wide installed socks package. Socks is needed to fetch the galaxy code 
    from other sources but is not available in the galaxy's venv. To avoid the catch 22 we append the system-wide pythonpath 
    
    **Important**: If the patch does not work, and the role fails at the task _Create Galaxy virtualenv_, copy the files:
    
			cp /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/socks* /cluster/galaxy/srv/galaxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages
			cp /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/transitions* /cluster/galaxy/srv/galaxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages
			cp /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipaddress* /cluster/galaxy/srv/galaxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages
			cp /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/construct* /cluster/galaxy/srv/galaxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages


## PostgreSQL backup disable

Comment the backup of he DB in  `galaxyproject.postgresql/tasks/main.yml`

			#- include_tasks: backup.yml
			#  when: postgresql_backup_dir is defined


## OpenIdc 

Place the backend (*.py file*) here:

		/galaxy/srv/galaxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/social_core/backends

The necessary changes to the authnz files (the files managing the authentication procedure) :

		/galaxy/srv/galaxy/server/lib/galaxy/authnz : psa_authnz.py
		/galaxy/srv/galaxy/server/lib/galaxy/authnz: managers.py
		
are made in the role *lifeportal.customized* in *tasks/main.yml*. These changes add the icons of the endpoints and add backends and backends names


## Slurm (for submit host)

- copy all the _fox-slurm_ rpms from `/cluster/staff/slurm/20.11.8/`
- install them : `yum localinstall fox-slurm-*`
- copy all the `*.conf` files from  `/etc/slurm` in any fox login host
- edit the value of `ControlMachine` in the file `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf` like this : `ControlMachine=los.fox.ad.fp.educloud.no`
- install munge with yum
- copy the `munge.key` file from any fox login node to `/etc/munge/` 
- add _slurm_ user to `/etc/passwd` - copy the line from any fox login node
- copy the controll machine ip to `/etc/hosts` - los

		10.110.0.2	los los.fox
		10.111.0.2	los-mgmt los-mgmt.fox
		10.112.0.2	los-ib los-ib.fox


## Mounting of directories

- The directory `/galaxy` is a mounted directory from ESS
		aspasia.ad.fp.educloud.no:/fp/fox01/galaxy  /galaxy    nfs rw,bg,hard,intr,tcp,nfsvers=3
- The directory `/cluster`is a mounted directory from FOX
		aspasia.ad.fp.educloud.no:/fp/fox01  /cluster    nfs ro,bg,hard,intr,tcp,nfsvers=3
		
		
## Monitoring and reports

The program _gxadmin_ allows the admin (as _galaxy_ user) to query the framework for various parameteres. It is installed as a separate role `galaxyproject.gxadmin` which is set in the `requirements.yml`. To use it set the PGDATABASE variable in `.bashrc`for _galaxy_ user.

		export PGDATABASE=galaxy
		
Then run the commands like

		gxadmin query latest-users
		gxadmin query job-info
		
etc.
